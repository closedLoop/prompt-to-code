# Create Branch Function

The `create_branch` function is used to create a new git branch with a given branch name.

## Parameters

- `branch_name` (str): The name of the new branch.
- `branches` (list): A list containing the names of existing branches.
- `has_stashed_changes` (bool): Indicates whether there are stashed changes that might conflict during branch creation.

## Behavior

The function performs the following checks before creating the branch:

1. Validates the branch name, ensuring it does not contain spaces, slashes, or backslashes.
2. Checks if the branch name is already in use.
3. Alerts the user if there are stashed changes that might conflict during branch creation.

If all checks pass, the function proceeds with the branch creation (logic should be implemented by the user) and prints a success message.

## Usage

```python
branches = ["master", "develop"]
has_stashed_changes = False

create_branch("feature/new_feature", branches, has_stashed_changes)
```

This will create a new branch called 'feature/new_feature' if it doesn't already exist and there are no stashed changes that might cause conflicts.
