TASKFORCE
=========

The components of a task force, whether it consists of human participants, AI agents, or a combination of both, can vary depending on the specific objectives and context. Generally, the key components include:

## Configuration

 * **Purpose**: A clearly defined goal or problem that the task force is designed to address.

 * **Members**: A diverse group of individuals or AI agents with relevant skills, expertise, or knowledge. The members could include subject matter experts, decision-makers, analysts, project managers, or other relevant stakeholders.

 * **Leadership**: An individual or AI agent responsible for coordinating the efforts of the task force, ensuring communication, and guiding the group towards its objectives.

 * **Resources**: The necessary tools, technology, data, and support required for the task force to successfully carry out its mission.

 * **Timeline**: A predetermined schedule outlining the duration of the task force's operation, including key milestones and deadlines for completing specific tasks or phases.

 * **Communication channels**: Efficient and effective means of sharing information, ideas, and updates among task force members and with external stakeholders, if needed.

 * **Decision-making process**: A method for making decisions and resolving conflicts within the task force, which may involve consensus-building, majority voting, or input from a designated authority.

## Execution and Review

 * **Evaluation and feedback**: Mechanisms for monitoring progress, assessing the task force's performance, and incorporating feedback to refine strategies or tactics as needed.

 * **Documentation and reporting**: Clear records of the task force's activities, findings, and recommendations, which may be used to inform future actions, policies, or decision-making processes.

 * **Disbanding**: A plan for concluding the task force's operation once its objectives have been met or when it is no longer needed. This may include a formal review or debriefing, as well as recognizing the contributions of the task force members.


## ORG

A `WorkerAgent` assumes a `Role` to complete a `Task` in given certain runtime `environments`.

`WorkerAgents` follow a set of `Workflows` to complete each `action item` using a set of `Tools`.

A `Tool` can be any type of resource that is used to complete an Action Item. This includes, but is not limited to, software, hardware, data, and human resources.  It must be callable from the runtime `environment` and configured with the proper API Key and credentials if necessary.


WorkerAgents are assigned to a TaskForce to complete parent tasks.


# Example
for a coding challenge we have 100 prompts to write code

The lead agent receives each prompt as an `action_item` via cli/api/slack/email/txt/github issue/whatever.

The lead agent then assigns the prompt to a worker agent (This can be done manually or automatically):
 * We have a list of available workers, a set of historical results (for few-shot learning), and a set of historical performance metrics (for meta-learning).
    * We can use this information to assign the prompt to the worker that is most likely to complete the task successfully.

For experimentation, we run this as different 'taskforces' where we can configure WorkerAgents to use different and increasingly complex workflows to complete the task.  These workflows can use different tools and different configurations of the same tools.

We know that each worker agent can output tasks in a certain format.


An WorkerAgent
 - Receives an action_item and is placed in an initial state
 - is given a set of machines to run on
